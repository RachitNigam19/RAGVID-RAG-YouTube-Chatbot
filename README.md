# 🎥 VIDRAG: RAG-YouTube-Chatbot
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based YouTube chatbot built with LangChain, designed to answer questions about video content using end-to-end pipelines. The project demonstrates expertise in generative AI, document processing, and conversational interfaces for multimedia content.
📖 Overview
VIDRAG is an innovative chatbot that leverages RAG techniques to query and retrieve information from YouTube videos. Using LangChain's pipeline architecture, the system processes video transcripts, embeds them for semantic search, and generates contextually relevant responses via large language models (LLMs). This end-to-end solution showcases skills in AI integration, vector databases, and user-facing chat applications. The complete project files are packaged in VIDRAG PROJECT.zip for easy setup and exploration.
🎯 Features

Processes YouTube video transcripts for RAG-based querying.
Semantic search using embeddings for accurate retrieval.
Conversational interface powered by LangChain chains and LLMs.
End-to-end pipeline: transcription, embedding, retrieval, and generation.
Modular design for easy customization and extension.
Supports multiple video sources and question types.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
LangChain: Framework for building RAG pipelines and LLM chains.
YouTube API: For video transcript extraction (assumed via yt-dlp or similar).
Embeddings: OpenAI or Hugging Face models for vector representations.
Vector Store: Chroma or FAISS for efficient retrieval.
Streamlit/Gradio: For the interactive chatbot UI (assumed in project files).
Git: Version control with .gitignore for clean repository management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git
YouTube API key (if using official API)
OpenAI API key (for embeddings/LLM, if applicable)

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/VIDRAG.git
cd VIDRAG


Extract the project files:
Unzip VIDRAG PROJECT.zip to access the full codebase.


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If requirements.txt is inside the zip, extract and run from the project root.)
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file with API keys (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here, YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here).



Usage

Run the main application (e.g., Streamlit chatbot):streamlit run app.py


Access the chatbot at http://localhost:8501.


Input a YouTube video URL and ask questions about its content.
The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant transcript segments and generates answers.
Explore the pipeline scripts in the extracted project files for customization.

🔍 How It Works

Transcript Extraction: Fetches and processes YouTube video transcripts using API or tools like yt-dlp.
Embedding Generation: Converts transcript chunks into vector embeddings using LangChain-compatible models.
Vector Storage: Stores embeddings in a vector database (e.g., Chroma) for fast similarity search.
RAG Pipeline: Retrieves relevant chunks based on user queries and augments LLM prompts for accurate generation.
Chat Interface: LangChain chains handle the conversation flow, providing context-aware responses.
